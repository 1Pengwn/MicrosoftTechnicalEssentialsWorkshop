A brief description of your project

This courseware is part of a project focused on delivering case study workshops designed to embolden diverse veteran communities through job training, mentoring, and education to transform lives and empower veterans. This course introduces the essentials required for learners to provide value in todayâ€™s job markets where modern technology is at the forefront of digital transformation.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get started.

```code to automate or manual task
<place holder> Example: System.Console.WriteLine("Fast Lane rocks!");
```

what actually happens when you execute.

example output: Fast Lane rocks!

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration.
This is the section where you would document those requirements.



## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

``` code to automate or manual task
<place holder> Example: System.Console.WriteLine("Fast Lane rocks!");
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```code to automate or manual task
<place holder> Example: System.Console.WriteLine("Fast Lane rocks!");
```


### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```code to automate or manual task
<place holder> Example: System.Console.WriteLine("Fast Lane rocks!");
```

Explain what the previous code actually does.

## Contributing


"If you'd like to contribute, please fork(copy) the repository and use a feature (non master)
branch. Pull (colloborative review) requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: <place holder>
- Repository: <place holder>
- Issue tracker: <place holder>
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    david.santana@fastlaneus.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
